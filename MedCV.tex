  {\bfseries HIV-induced cognitive \& immune impairment in a preferential cocaine using cohort} \newline
  Role on Project:  Co-Investigator \newline
  HIV-1 infection and subsequent therapeutic management can be modulated by a variety of cofactors, including substance abuse, which continues to be a major driver of global infection due to classical risk factors including risky sexual behavior and injection drug use (IDU).  However, HIV prevalence among non-injecting drug users has also grown to levels similar to those observed for IDU, and polysubstance use is common among HIV-1-infected populations.  Through development of the HIV-1-infected DREXELMED HIV/AIDS Genetic Analysis Cohort, we have identified cocaine abuse as the most prevalent substance of abuse in this Philadelphia-centered patient population with preferential cocaine use clearly evident in the population paralleled by a substantial cohort of polysubstance abusers as determined by routine drug screening.  Cocaine has been shown to affect both immune activation and cellular gene expression including transcription factors resulting in impact on HIV-1 gene expression and pathogenesis.  HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation induced by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, including substance abuse (most notably cocaine), while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity. In this proposal, we will utilize molecular and systems biology approaches to generate an overall picture of important pathways in HIV-1 pathogenesis and how cocaine interacts with and affects these pathways and the development of viral quasispecies over the course of disease.  The overall Hypothesis of the proposed studies is that alterations in the cross talk between HIV-1 and the host due to cocaine abuse will increase the rate of HIV-1 disease progression and result in immune dysregulation with the genesis of a viral quasispecies unique to preferential users of cocaine.  We have illustrated the importance of linear protein sequence motifs and LTR footprints in viral-host cross talk during the course of our preliminary investigations.  In this application, we will quantify the HIV-1 protein sequence motifs and TF footprints on the HIV-1 LTR enriched in sequences associated with cocaine abuse as well as quantify and compare global gene and immune activation profiles of HIV-1-infected individuals with no history of substance abuse (PN) and with preferential cocaine addiction (PC). The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) examine the impact of cocaine on HIV-1 LTR and viral protein host motifs; (2) enhance the clinical demographics and neuropsychological analysis associated with PN, PC, and multi-use subcohorts within the DREXELMED HIV/AIDS Genetic Analysis Cohort; and (3) determine the impact of preferential cocaine use on immune regulatory pathways in HIV-1-infected patients.  This proposal will develop and utilize unique HIV-1-infected patient subcohorts to determine the overall impact of cocaine use on human and viral gene expression, immune activation, and selection of viral quasispecies.  These studies will significantly impact research on HIV/AIDS and cocaine abuse through the identification of new targets and strategies for anti-HIV-1 therapeutics and strategies to minimize the impact of substance abuse on HIV disease progression and overall human health.\newline

  {\bfseries CSF HIV compartmentalization and neuroimmune correlates of HAND in military HIV+} \newline
  Role on Project:  Co-Investigator \newline
  Nearly one fifth to one third of HIV-infected individuals develop neurocognitive deficits, collectively referred to as HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), despite adequate combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and excellent virological control in blood. HIV is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soon after a primary infection  and traffics into brain early in the course of infection where it resides in perivascular macrophages and microglial cells, sites of productive replication and viral evolution. Importantly the virus  enters the brain in only about 50\% of patients as detected by molecular methods at the time of death. For those with central nervous system (CNS) infection, complete suppression of HIV replication in the brain is challenging due to the selectively permeable blood brain barrier that interferes with bioavailability of cART in brain.  Multiple mechanisms have been proposed as to how low level viral replication may lead to neurocognitive disorders.  Thus it is critically important to identify patients who may not have HIV in the brain as they may have the lowest risk of HAND and/or the best chance for curative therapies.  A cure for HIV infection is not possible unless safe heavens of the virus are purged and total eradication of HIV from the host is achieved.  An essential step toward this end is identification of host and viral responses in the CNS both among recently seroconverted individuals and those on long term cART.  In the U.S. military, although HIV infected members may remain on active duty, they are restricted by policy from some positions (e.g. pilot of high performance aircraft) and for the most part from overseas deployments, largely due to concerns about neurocognitive dysfunction.  This proposal brings together investigators in the fields of HIV neuroimmunology, neurovirology and neuroradiology with a team of clinical researchers leveraging a unique population of military members who are routinely screened for HIV infection.  We will employ highly sensitive biomarker assays as well as viral and proviral HIV deep sequencing and evolutionary analysis to characterize HIV infections in the CNS of these subjects in detail and longitudinally. \newline

  {\bfseries Defining the HIV-1 R5 genotype beyond the envelope and in viral reservoirs} \newline
  Role on Project:  Co-Investigator \newline
  HIV-1 is known to interact with the cell surface receptor CD4 in conjunction with a chemokine coreceptor, either CCR5 (R5) or CXCR4 (X4). R5-utilizing viruses are more commonly found emerging in the peripheral blood (PB) following the selection bottleneck after sexual transmission, in the early asymptomatic stages of disease and treatment-naÃ¯ve patients, within the brain at end-stage disease, and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during HIV CNS disease; whereas X4-utilizing viruses emerge later in the course of disease in approximately 50-60\% of infected individuals with an average time to emergence of 5 years. The presence of X4 virus in an infected patient has been shown to be a predictor of lower CD4+ T-cell count, higher viral load, and greater degree of HIV disease severity. However, more recent analyses have implied that lower CD4+ T-cell counts and higher viral loads may be observed with dual/mixed tropic virus compared to that associated with patients carrying R5 or X4 virus as their predominant virus. In addition, we have recently demonstrated through bioinformatics analyses that there appears to be defined subgroups of R5 viruses that may have specific pathogenic properties and may be more or less prevalent at different stages of disease, within different cellular/tissue compartments involved in immunologic and neurologic dysfunction, and development of viral reservoirs prior to or after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.  Furthermore, recent studies have also indicated that X4- and R5-specific colinear nucleotide and amino acid sequences as defined by the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) algorithm utilizing the Env-V3 sequence exist within the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) as well as Tat and Vpr, respectively. These highly innovative concepts have paved the way for defining in greater detail the molecular architecture of the X4, R5, and R5 subgroups (and eventually the dual tropic virus) beyond the well characterized signature sequences contained within Env-V3 sequence to the rest of the viral genome, in particular the LTR, Tat, and Vpr sequences, the focus of this proposal. The studies outlined in this proposal will utilize PB and CSF samples from cross-population and longitudinal studies from several cohorts in addition to brain samples collected from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) for sequencing and structure/function analyses to examine the working hypothesis that R5 subgroups can be categorized by sequence clustering and the individual subgroups correlate with disease severity and other clinical parameters including neurocognitive impairment and immune activation and relates to reservoir development and cellular compartmentalization.  The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Enhance collection and definition of samples from patients classified as nonusers with respect to drugs of abuse utilizing NGS; (2) Determine envelope phenotype for patient samples and categorize into X4-utilizing or R5-utilizing with classification into R5 subgroups; (3) Identify the immune activation profile of various R5 subgroups and correlate with clinical parameters including neurocognitive impairment; and (4) Determine the function of the viral proteins beyond the envelope and correlate the function to the various R5 subgroups. \newline

  {\bfseries The HIV-1 CNS reservoir: macrophage tropism, latency and eradication} \newline
  Role on Project:  Co-Investigator \newline
  HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) present in the brain of infected individuals are characterized by their macrophage tropism, or the ability to efficiently infect macrophages. Indeed, macrophages and microglia, the resident brain macrophage, support most if not all productive viral replication within the brain compartment. HIV-1 is believed to enter the CNS early after systemic infection and might either be cleared, or continue to reside there and perhaps maintain a low level, continuous replication, which may lead, at least in a subset of infected individuals, to the development of neurocognitive manifestations of varying severity, known collectively as HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders. The brain thus may contain productively and latently infected cells, and in the context of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) and eradication efforts, may become a viral reservoir. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether HIV-1 infection within the brain can eventually re-seed non-CNS tissues after viral eradication using cART. In other words, whether the CNS can truly act as a functional reservoir for HIV-1. Macrophage tropic Env are also known to have altered reactivity to certain types of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and small molecules/inhibitors that target various steps of the receptor-mediated binding and entry process. We and others have shown that macrophage-tropic Env have increased exposure of epitopes that are recognized by Abs that are generally produced in HIV-1 infected individuals, resulting in increased sensitivity to neutralization by HIV-1 positive sera, and by Abs targeting the CD4-induced (CD4i) epitopes that partially overlap with the bridging sheet regions that form the co-receptor binding site. In addition, an inverse relationship between macrophage tropism and sensitivity to inhibition by certain gp120- or gp41-targeted entry or fusion inhibitors, respectively (such as BMS-378806, T20 and T1249) has also been observed, whereas another class of gp120 inhibitors, the 12p1-derived peptides, actually seems to target more efficiently macrophage-tropic than non-macrophage-tropic Env. Thus, it is of great interest to determine whether macrophages and microglia infected with viruses containing macrophage-tropic Env will only be producing a progeny of virions containing Envs with this phenotype or rather a mixture of viruses containing both macrophage-tropic and non-macrophage-tropic Env. Our overall hypothesis is that macrophages/microglia infected with viruses with macrophage-tropic Env produce progeny virions with both macrophage- and non-macrophage-tropic Env, which will be able to re-seed infection of non-CNS peripheral tissues after viral eradication with cART. To test this hypothesis, or specific goals are: (i) to investigate in vitro how HIV-1 is able to establish and maintain viral replication in the CNS, and how the CNS can potentially serve as a reservoir from which the virus can re-seed peripheral tissues in the context of viral eradication efforts; (ii) to finely define the determinants for differential sensitivity of macrophage-tropic and non-macrophage-tropic Env to two types of entry inhibitors (BMS-378806 and related small molecules, and 12p1-related peptides); and (iii) to use the RAG-hu mouse model of HIV-1 infection to define in vivo early mechanisms of HIV-1 neuroinvasion and establishment of viral replication and/or latency in the brain, to determine the potential efficacy of targeted interventions against HIV-1 infection of the CNS and re-infection of peripheral tissues, and to study the role of cellular trafficking and CNS inflammation in maintaining viral persistence within this compartment.
